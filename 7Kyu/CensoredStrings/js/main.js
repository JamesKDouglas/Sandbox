// parameters: The first input is a string with missing letters. Missing letters are marked with an asterisk.
//The second input is a list of the missing letters, with the correct order and case.

// return: The restored string. 
// example:
//uncensor("*h*s *s v*ry *tr*ng*", "Tiiesae") âžœ "This is very strange"

// pseudocode:
// Build a completely new string.
// Use for loop and replace to go through the string repeatedly, looking for an asterisk. When a character is replaced keep count. This will be the index for the next character to put in.

//We'll extract the character with charAt.
