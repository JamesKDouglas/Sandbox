# CodeWars

This is just a repository to share some solutions to CodeWars. It contains training exercises that vary from 8 to 4 kyu.

At the 100Devs agency we have a guideline for using the CodeWars website: If you've been working on something for over 20 minutes, look at the solution. 

So try the exercises on you own first, then if you are having difficulty please take a look. These are my solutions, and are often more verbose than the solutions focused on regex or "code golf" solutions. 

The exercises generally are coded using the "template" folder. Feel free to do the same - whenever you start a new local CodeWars initiative and want a framework to just make a local VScode JavaScript file, use a copy of the template.

Also, for any HR staff or recruiters viewing this: please don't consider this the only code I've done! CodeWars is a good site for practicing coding and easy to share. It is rarely the only work that coders are doing.
