//We've got an equation:
//S(n, z) = (1 - z)(z + z**2 + z**3 + ... + z**n)

//in which z is a complex number, so of the form (a+bi) where a and b are real.

//What we are expecting is that as n goes to infinity, if z is in its domain of
//convergence then S(n,z) goes to a finite value. 

//Given z, where z is within the domain, what is the convergence value as n approaches
//infinity?
